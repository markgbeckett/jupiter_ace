# A-Mouz-in-Mase

## Background

In May 2021, the curator of the [Jupiter Ace Archive](https://www.jupiter-ace.co.uk/) posted a [message on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JA_Archive/status/1399479238328295424), asking for help to recover one of a small number of games that he had recently recovered from cassette. The game in question was known simply as MAZE and, as the name suggests, was supposed to be some kind of maze game. Two versions were available: the raw, recovered program, which had various corruption; and a partially recovered version, in which all but a word named SCAN seemed to be okay.

I decided to have a go at recovering the game, and to see if I could find out more about it.

I downloaded both versions, though was initially unable to load the part-recovered version, so started from the original.

The good news was that the original _rip_ of the cassette loaded and could be run. It opened with a screen of instructions (which also confirmed the game name to be _A-Mouz-in-Mase_ (sic.), before asking you to choose a maze size, and then starting to build a maze. Unfortunately, shortly after starting the maze-build, the program crashed, resetting the Ace.

The source code had no information on the origins of the game: who wrote it, who published it, and when it was written. I still have not found any of this information, so would be happy to hear from anyone who knows more.
