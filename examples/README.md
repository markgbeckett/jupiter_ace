# Example Forth Code - Canonical Pile Calculator

The sightly dull-sounding Forth example Canonical Pile Calculator, from Leo Brodie's book [Starting Forth](https://forth.com/starting-forth/12-forth-code-example/) is well worth studying, if you want to learn Forth. 

I have created a port of this example to Ace Forth. To use this port, either:

* Open the TAP file (canonical_pile_calculator.tap) in your preferred emulator.
* Enter `LOAD pile`.
* Use `VLIST` and `LIST` to examine the source code.
* Run the code by selecting a material and then initiating a calculation. For example:

```
CEMENT
10 FOOT 6 INCH PILE
```

Alternatively, if you have a Minstrel 4th with a USB Keyboard Interface or a Minstrel 4D, you can transmit the source code (canonical_pile_calculator.fs) from your PC using a serial terminal.
