Attempting to disassemble the program, the main game loop is a series of calls at 3C80h:

3C80  call 41C8 - does nothing
3C83  call 3EE0 ; Seems to shift screen left and right
      	   jp 4940
	      checks if 46E0
3C86  call 3F28 -
      	   check 3F90 is 0x0000 (bullet is in flight)
	   then check fire (bit 0 of port FDFE)
3C89  call 3EE0 ; Seems to shift screen left and right
      	   jp 4940
	      check 46E0
3C8C  call 3F28 - check fire
3C8F  call 3EF0 - check keyboard directions
      	   call 3E60 (from 3F03)
	   	Check port DFFE
3C92  call 44E8 -
      	   Check 4180 (number of caterpillar segments?)
                 44D8
			4460 Check if caterpillar segment is an 8 (maybe is shot?)
			46D0 Check if caterpillar segment+60 is a 6 (???)
			44B0
			4290
			9630
3C95  call 46FE - Move caterpillar
3C98  jp 3C80h

Default keyboard controls are
   Fire - Port FDFE Bit 0 'a'
   Up     Port DFFE Bit 2 'i'
   Right  Port BFFE Bit 1 'l'
   Left	  Port BFFE Bit 3 'j'
   Down	  Port 7FFE Bit 1 'm'

Caterpillar is stored in 4100--410B (row coord)
                         4120--412B (col coord)

VLIST is at 62D
FIND is at 63D
FORGET is at 1634
LIST IS AT 1670

DATA starts at 3C5C, followed by MORECODE, followed by CENTIPEDE (code
field at 4B33)

Main game entry point is at 3C60

Differences between Ace version and Atari console original:

- Atari version is two-player.

- In original, difficulty level can be configured (by arcade, rather
  than player)

- Screen has 28 rows on Atari.

- Atari version of game has colour

- Atari version initially places up to 46 mushrooms. Ace has a 25%
  chance of placing a mushroom at each location, which mean on average
  there will be 165 mushrooms
