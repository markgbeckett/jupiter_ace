3D MONSTER MAZE

"Roll up, roll up. See the amazing Tyrannosauras Rex in his lair.
Perfectly preserved in silicon since prehistoric times, he us brought to
you for your entertainment and exhileration.

If you dare to enter his lair, you do so at your own risk. The
management accepts no responsibility for the health and safety of the
adventurer who enters the realm. The management advise that this is not
a game for those of a nervous disposition."

Can you find your way through the maze and escape before Rex catches
you? This is a remake of the classic ZX81 game, ported to the Jupiter
Ace (with 16kb RAM pack) or Minstrel 4th, and exploiting the speed and
compactness of Forth to make the most terrifying version yet.

LOADING

1. Connect the audio output from your cassette player to the Ear socket on your Ace/ Minstrel 4th.

2. Enter LOAD 3DMM (case of filename is important) on you Ace/ Minstrel 4th.

3. Press play on the cassette player (with volume set to loud). The game takes around 90 seconds to load and success is confirmed with an OK prompt.

4. Type 3DMM to start the game.

Loading games into a real Ace/ Minstrel 4th may require a little trial and error to get the volume correct.

Instructions are included in the game. The aim of the game is to find the exit before Rex catches you. You can move around the maze using 5 to turn left, 6 to move forward, and 8 to turn right.
