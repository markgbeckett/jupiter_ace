3D MONSTER MAZE

This is a remake of the classic ZX81 game, for the Jupiter Ace (with 16kb RAM pack) or Minstrel 4th, exploiting the speed and compactness of Forth to make the most terrifying version yet. Can you find your way through the maze and escape before Rex catches you?

LOADING

1. Connect the audio output from your cassette player to the Ear socket on your Ace/ Minstrel 4th.

2. Enter "LOAD 3DMM" (case of filename is important) on you Ace/ Minstrel 4th.

3. Press play on the cassette player (with volume set to loud). The game takes around 90 seconds to load and success is confirmed with an OK prompt.

4. Enter "3DMM" to start the game.

Loading games into a real Ace/ Minstrel 4th may require a little trial and error to get the volume correct.

Instructions are included in the game. The aim of the game is to find the exit before Rex catches you. You can move around the maze using 5 to turn left, 6 to move forward, and 8 to turn right. If you are stuck, press ? to see a map and Rex's movements.
